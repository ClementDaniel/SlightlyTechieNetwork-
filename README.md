# What is docker 

Docker is an open-source platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It enables you to package your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development called a container. This container can then be run on any operating system that supports Docker, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

Docker containers are lightweight and portable, making them ideal for microservices architectures and cloud computing. They are also isolated from each other, which means that one container cannot interfere with another. This makes Docker a very secure platform for running applications.

Docker is used by a wide range of organizations, from small startups to large enterprises. It is a popular choice for developing and deploying web applications, mobile applications, and data science applications.

## Benefits of using Docker:

- Agility: Docker makes it easy to develop and deploy applications quickly and efficiently.
- Portability: Docker containers can be run on any operating system that supports Docker, making them very portable.
- Scalability: Docker containers are lightweight and easy to scale up or down, making them ideal for cloud computing and microservices architectures.
- Security: Docker containers are isolated from each other, which makes them very secure.
  ## key concepts in Docker:

- Images: Docker images are immutable blueprints for creating containers. They contain all the necessary code, libraries, and dependencies to run an application.
- Containers: Docker containers are running instances of Docker images. They are lightweight and isolated from each other.
- Dockerfile :To create a Docker image, developers typically write a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains instructions for building an image. These instructions specify the base image, application code, and any necessary configuration.
- Docker Registry: Docker Registry is a central repository for storing and sharing Docker images.
#### To get started with Docker, you can install Docker Desktop on your local machine. This will give you a Docker environment where you can develop, test, and deploy your applications.

Once you have Docker Desktop installed, you can start building and running Docker images and containers. There are many resources available online https://docs.docker.com/ to help you get started with Docker.

### Some examples of how Docker can be used:

- Developing applications: Docker can be used to create isolated development environments for each developer. This can help to improve productivity and reduce conflicts.
- Testing applications: Docker can be used to create test environments that are identical to the production environment. This can help to improve the quality of testing.
- Deploying applications: Docker can be used to deploy applications to any environment that has Docker installed. This makes it easy to deploy applications to the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment

Short example of using Docker
Here is a short example of how to use Docker to run a web application:

###### Build a Docker image for your web application
docker build -t my-web-app .

###### Run a Docker container from the image
docker run -p 80:80 my-web-app

###### Visit the web application in your browser at http://localhost:80
This will start a Docker container running your web application on port 80. You can then visit the web application in your browser at http://localhost:80.
